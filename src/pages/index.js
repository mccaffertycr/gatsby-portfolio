          I'm a Full Stack Developer currently based out of the Philadelphia
          area. For as long as I can remember I've loved spending way too much
          time on the computer and I spent my teens gaming and tinkering with
          things like Photoshop and GarageBand. <br />
          <br />
          In 2018 I completed a Full Stack Boot Camp at UPenn and my focus has
          been on web programming since then, mostly creating responsive
          single-page applications. I'm very passionate about creating engaging
          user experiences and interested in gamification as a way to
          incentivize engagement and interactivity. <br />
